# Introduction

Hello, I'm Wesley, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

There are in general two types of deep learning models - **discriminative** and **generative** models. 

An example of a **discriminative** model in NLP is a **text classification model** like my previous notebook *[Twitter Emotion Classification with BERT](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wesleyacheng/twitter-emotion-classification-with-bert)* where we classified each tweet into one of three emotions - joy, anger, and sadness.
On the other hand, an example of a **generative** model in NLP is an **autoregressive text model** like the recently mainstream **ChatGPT** where it predicts/generates its next words based on the input sentence you provide it with.

Here's an example of what a **generative** NLP model can do.

Here's the link to their [blog post](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) if you want to know more about **ChatGPT** and how it was fine-tuned from GPT-3.5 with reinforcement learning.

The **main difference** between a **discriminative** model and a **generative** model is that **discriminative** models *predict where a new unknown data point might fit in its data distribution based the dataset it was trained on*, hence it outputs a class/category; while a **generative** model *uses the new unknown data point as a starting point to predict/generate new data points that are highly related to it*, hence it outputs similar content that is highly related to the input it was given.
 
These two types of models are different as they tackle different problems. **Discriminative** models tackle the problem of *how to split the dataset into clusters with similar features*, while **generative** models tackle the *problem of how to use the dataset to make new data that are highly similar to it*.

As an introduction to **generative** models in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in this notebook, we will be doing the **classic machine translation task** (a **generative** problem) of translating **English to French** by transfer learning with **Google's T5 model** [\[blog\]](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html). We will be using the *HuggingFace NLP interface* to simplify this introduction. Let's get going! ðŸ¦¾
